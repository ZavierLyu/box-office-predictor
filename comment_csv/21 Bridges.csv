"Good old fashioned cops and robbers movie,solid acting and great shootouts.Wish there was more of this type of movie!"
"The film was a pleasant surprise. Nothing new here but the camera work and action scenes were marvelous. Although the plot is not original the story was fine with good editing. Interesting take on ""Manhattan island"", however the script could have been better and acting was average at times. Nice Friday night flick!"
"I thought it was pretty thrilling and suspenseful police drama, that went fast enough not to bore me.
I found the production to be pretty big with the whole thing about the movie being produced by the same guys who made Avengers: End game and it has a decent set of actors in it, but you're not going to get any substance from it. No depth just action. It has a message but the message does not out weight the dramatic action sequences. The Russo brothers could have done so much more with what they were given but they didn't.
And is that what Chadwick Boseman really sounds like? I herd him mimic so many famous black people that I had no idea what he actually sounds like.
Anyway. It's a good popcorn eating action movie. It's not met to win awards just make you satisfied when spending the two hours to see it."
"This is the type of film I've seen a hundred times or more on DVD, Netflix etc, but for some reason never think of going to see at the cinema. Our multiplex is getting renovated so they're a few screens down and when we got down there it was the only thing about to start in the next half hour. It's not going to win awards but it will entertain you.. it's not really going to keep you guessing but you will want to see how it pans out. It's not going to stay in my memory but it does make me want to see more of this type at the cinema rather than at home. Good, honest film."
"This Chadwick Bose man film is gripping thriller and there is no time you will feel bored watching it. The treatment to such a simple script which falls short due to its predictability is overcome by stinctilating cinematography, memorable well written characters and a believable premise set in Manhattan New York. The Climax tells a bigger picture of the cops world giving us a glimpse of the system as a whole with Stephan James and Chadwick Boseman leaving an impact with their honest performances. Give it a Watch for sure."
"Crime action thriller.Starts with our hero as a child at his father's funeral and some character building backstory, then flashes forwards to our hero who is now a detective with a reputation for killing cop killers, though he doesn't shoot without just cause. The action centres on a night time drugs robbery gone wrong, where 7 cops gets killed. The rest is the pursuit of the criminals.The decision is made to shut down all 21 city bridges around Manhattan so the killers can't escape, but there's a twist, it appears that the entire police department, except our hero are corrupt, unfortunately the conspiracy is far too predictable."
"Yeah there are some overly dramatic spots but they didn't skimp on the action. Simple plot, simple use of detective stuff, and some good bad guys. Not bad if you've already seen Joker, Knives out, Doctor Sleep, etc.Due to the success of ""black panther/get on up"" you'll expect Chadwick Boseman to just start yelling something epic in the middle of it haha"
"When two cop killers are on the loose with 50 kilograms of uncut cocaine, detective Andre Harris (Chadwick Boseman) makes the bold move of cutting off their exit from Manhattan by blocking its 21 bridges--hence the title. I doubt a detective would have that much authority but nevermind that.From that point on it's a race to catch these killers before 5 a.m., the time in which Manhattan will be opened back up. What Det. Harris also found out is that he was racing against more than just the clock, he was racing against others who wanted the cop killers dead to cover up a bigger crime.The movie stays fast paced for the most part. Little time is spent on exposition, back stories, or side stories. The bulk of the movie occurs within a single night so there's no time to slow things down to delve into anyone's personal life. It is a crime drama with some mystery involved.It was an entertaining movie, something cool to catch at a matinee while everyone else was crowding in to watch Frozen 2."
"I just got out of 21 BridgesIt's predictable (The twists are obvious) the dialogue is also routine and predictable (my son was saying some of the lines before the actors) but overall, I enjoyed it. A decent enough way to pass 90 minutesChadwick Bosnan is an effective leader and JK Simmons offers solid support but the always awesome Kieth David was under used and whilst the rest of the cast (Sienna Miller, Taylor Kitch) is all fine, it Stephen James was the stand out for me, I actually wanted him to get away at times.There were only 19 other people in my screening"
"21 Bridges is a great crime thriller that's tense and thrilling and also manages to (surprisingly) explore some morally grey aspects, despite it's generic plot. Chadwick Boseman gives a great lead performance. Taylor Kitsch and Stephan James are also great and Sienna Miller and J. K. Simmons are both really good. Brian Kirk's direction is excellent, keeping the film constantly moving and mobile, resulting in a great pace. The shootouts are well filmed and thrilling. The music by Henry Jackman and Alex Belcher is fantastic."
"This movie was actually very good. Chadwick Boseman did it again. Delivers a great performance once again. Lot of fun thrilling brutal action scenes throughout. Plot good too. Twist was a tiny bit predictable, still was a good twist. Fun action movie. Definitely entertaining."
"Ok, so the sub-plot and underlying corruption is NOT original, the integrity of the 3 main actors lends it to a murky, atmospheric cop ride not seen for some time.The two shooters, Kitsch and James, and the detective, Boseman, make this for riveting and oft times suspense-ful dramaGlad to see a gritty cop flick again"
"Great old fashioned Cops v robbers flick. Good Solid unshowy cast. Manhattan goes into lock down at night with two cop killers on the run. One brilliant chase scene on foot, the obligatory fruit stall hit by a car, car chases, shoot outs yes there is a subway scene too 😉 Brilliant cinematography and direction and great use of location. Full of adrenaline and if ya want a buzz watch this. The type of movie that will turn up on TV in a few years that you'll love and wonder why you haven't seen it before."
Good movie experience. Good story and direction. Acting on the whole good. Violent but not in the cartoonish way of many movies of lhe last decade or so. No over-relience on CGI or Special Effects which is refreshing. Soilid 8 out of 10 for entertainment value. Recommended!
"This movie wasn't spectacular, but it did serve the purpose of being fairly entertaining. Yes, I foresaw the ending by the midway point. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed this picture. The acting was solid. The story line, while fairly predictable, was believable and built good suspense at times.If you enjoy a good action flick without 99% CGI, you'll enjoy this movie for sure.Recommended."
"Bozeman was excellent. I thought the title was misleading....as for me, it implied the technicalities & challenges of closing the down the main arteries of Manhattan, but that simply referred to one of the LE tactics for catching the perps.Overall - excellent storyline & casting, but this is a movie I would've waited for cable to watch."
"Far not the best crime thriller ever but it is also far from worsers one,at least we got a chance to see boseman in something different except black panther and mcu,in the end 21 bridges has some cliches we saw a lot of times but they were mostly excuted in good way ,still cliches and some weaker dialogue took me from a film for a bit"
"I sometimes see people rate a movie highly and complain about the other low scores people have given it. Irks me particularly if the movie/series was actually poor. This film is not that!A well directed, well acted cop thriller with enough twists to keep you interested throughout the movie.Gritty, but also nuanced on who you end up rooting for in the movie. I genuinely can't understand the low ratings for this."
"The people who didn't like this movie obviously watched a different movie than I did. Me and wife watched it last night and even she liked it (and she normally doesn't like these types of movies.) I thought the writing was great, the directing was great and the cast led by Chadwick was absolutely top notch. If you like a good cop chasing the bad guys kind of movie, then this is your movie!Go watch it and enjoy!"
"Well folks, you can at anytime make room to go and see this movie . It is really good , from all the points of view ( ? ) : directorship , acting, script . The cinematography was a bit to dark, yes i understand ,that's the script, otherwise the whole movie was to cost way over this small 33mil.
And that's the merit of everyone in making this movie : whit such a small budget , a such a really good movie . Not perfect , but not bad at all . Money well spend ."
It has been long time since we seen a realistic action movie with great pursuit scenes
Just enough twists and unpredictability to make this better than most cop thrillers. Whilst some of it is pretty simple the lead performance is great and it's pacing is pretty much perfect. Much better than average if unfortunately not spectacular.
9/10 - now this is how you make a good action thriller
"REVIEW - 21 BRIDGESNot all criminals are bad, some may break the law for the right reasons, but the law is the law and....A guy participates in a crime but the partner in the said crime kills a number of Police, so a man hunt en sues.Thus set against a story of corrupt police who were corrupt in a Robin Hood style helping other police in financial difficulties.One cop sees through this to get to the truth by (no spoilers).Personality we have seen many films like this, most recently Black and Blue which I scored highly and again this, whilst in the same spirit as Black and Blue this film actually has a more realistic feel to it which I enjoyed, I especially loved the original music used, not what you expect.Rating 8 out of 10"
Another fine movie from Russo Brothers! Good work and right cast
"Act 1 - 5.0Act 2 - 4.5Act 3 - 3.2
Great cast but boring and unconvincing performancesNo impressive camera work outside the casket scene with the white glovesStory is basic and tends to play generic and dumbEverything in the movies makes sense and I think the movies thinks it's smarter than it isMovie doesn't earn any emotion as the only developed character is Andre the detectiveEnd of the film just gets laughable and stupid"
"If you missed classic, action packed movie, this is for you! Lots of action, everything is realistic."
"Awesome movie, for a while I've been waiting for this movie as I absolutely love thrillers. The movie was ok, awesome actors but I just feel the sorry was missing something."
"I'll be honest. I went in thinking I wasn't going to like it too much but I'm glad me wanting to support these actors outweighs any skepticism. I don't think the trailers gave it justice.Chadwick Boseman is just a good actor and Stephan James was right behind him. It reminded me of those throwback cop movies that aren't oversimplified but still entertaining enough to watch while sipping a beer on the couch.I think the actors were really cool taking on a movie like this that would be considered ""beneath them"". Sometimes all it takes is a simple and great story without all the CGI we've been rolling in over the past 10 years."
"This film is certainly fast-paced and full of action. It can be no surprise that every law enforcement officer apart from one is corrupt, but it's a fun journey to the end.There's some excellent use of surround sound in the cinema; at one point I thought there actually WAS a helicopter outside flying past!I wouldn't waste your money on seeing this in the cinema though, it's just not 'big enough' to justify the expense. I wouldn't be surprised if the script was stolen from an unused episode of 24.However, the final act is stolen from Clear and Present Danger. I sat in the cinema thinking ""I've definitely seen this before!"" and after a bit of thought, I realised where I had seen it. That's not to say it's a bad ending, it was excellent the first time it was used!Go on a two-for-one deal if your cinema has one, because this isn't worth paying full price for."
"A run of the mill police thriller which doesn't really do anything new, but is still good and entertaining to watch. Not as tense as I was expecting as it focuses on the drama and the pensive stances of the lead, but the acting's good (although the characters are rather cliché) and the action and overall style is realistic and gritty."
"Pretty standard dirty cop drama. chadwick is quite good. but it's all obvious. critics liked it, though. go figure."
Good movie. Boseman definitely had the Denzel vibe going. Live shots of Manhattan were spectacular. This movie ended way too soon. It moved pretty fast. All in all it was a pretty good movie.
". . . 1)Those who have proven to be Dirty, and 2)Dirty cops who are yet to be caught. The WHIPLASH guy bellyaches throughout 21 BRIDGES that cops' long hours produce a high divorce rate in their personal lives, entitling them to steal whatever their greedy grubby paws grab as a form of unearned compensation. This typical precinct captain further reasons that because SOMEONE might get rich off the killer drug scourge, it might as well be New York's ""Finest."" So he masterminds the nefarious scheme depicted in 21 BRIDGES through which the NYPD serves as the Mexican Drug Cartels' errand boys, ferrying around Kilos of Death like a satanic courier service. Anyone the least bit familiar with Current Events knows that America's present Real Life predicament is FAR WORSE than the dire situation exposed by 21 BRIDGES. This is why all defenders of Virtue, Freedom, Honesty, and Moral Behavior concur that the ENTIRE CROP of current U.S. cops MUST be disarmed, stripped of their ill-gotten assets and forfeit their citizenship before being deported to Siberia (forcibly, if necessary). We MUST do this ASAP! After all, we cannot expect the BLACK PANTHER to bail us out in Real Life!"
"I really don't understand the bad reviews
It was a good movie , I am sure you will enjoy it as well"
"Love the acting, angle camera, actor, everything really entertaining"
"21 Bridges (4 out of 5 stars).21 Bridges is an action packed thriller that leaves you on the edge until the end. The plot follows a NYPD detective Andre (Chadwick Boseman) who got a call on a shoot out involving several dead policeman from two suspects who were caught stealing drugs. A manhunt goes out with them closing 21 bridges to Manhattan to trap the suspects and uncovering a conspiracy about the suspects.Great and intense action with the shoot out scenes. The film is filled with a conspiracy twist which may be predictable when the suspects played by Taylor Kitsch and Stephan James come across a set up with their plan on stealing cocaine. Chadwick Boseman did great in the leading role. Sienna Miller was also good playing his partner. Taylor Kitschy and Stephan James was also good.Overall, 21 Bridges is a good action thriller if that is all your looking for. With a plot involving a conspiracy that will leave you hanging until the end."
"I was totally surprised. It was not at all what I thought it would be. The movie delivered!. Compelling story, predictably turns, but so many surprises. Great movie!"
"This is a short review because there is not much to say about this film really!! It is your average meat and potatoes cop film set in New York. There is nothing unique about the film but thats fine not everything has to be. Its a solid, well made film.Chadwick Boseman is very good.............its mainly his characters story, definitely does well in the lead. You easily gravitate towards his character early on in the film, likeable guy. J.K Simmons and Sienna Miller are good in there roles, Miller has a good accent but apart from that not much character development. But solid again. Nice small little role for Taylor Kitsch, really like him as an actor!!The story about the bridges.............meh, its not exactly that interesting !Overall is average/ok , 60% out of 100.......it is the definition of a meat and potatoes cop film..........nice, sort of ,twist at the end but nothing mind blowing you could something like it coming a mile off. Directed adequately, acting was good, story was boring but solid............its just fine, nothing more to it, well at least its not bad!!"
The thing I like about this movie is that it doesn't try to trick you with the twist and you should easily figure out early on. However how we get there was a lot of a fun and exciting. This is the type of action movie we need more of. It doesn't try to be more then it is and is a ton of fun. All the actors do a great job and there are a ton of fun and exciting action moments and lines
"Overall I thought this was a pretty good action thriller. While the storyline was a bit simplistic and predictable, the execution was top notch. Boseman played the part of hardened cop really well, and the supporting characters held their own. The storyline had good flow and kept up a good pace throughout. Enjoyable and worth the time to watch."
"It is a normal movie telling the story of normal people in a realistic way no cgi or superheroes here ,,,,, a classic action movie you will enjoy even if some people could get the plot easy.
Reminds me of 90's movies but in a modern way ,,,,, nice work"
"I didn't expect too much from this movie but CB is a really good actor, imo, right up there with Denzel! (I'd love to see them together in a movie). The story got my interest pretty much right out the gate and it didn't let up throughout the movie. For me, totally entertaining and the only con is that it was a bit too short. I would have liked to have seen more character development, but that did not take away from my enjoyment of the movie. Frankly, I'd like to see CB's character developed into a couple more movies."
"Was a good film, found it really raw and entertaining but it did have some problems relating to depth and time management. If you're unsure of whether to check this film out - I've written a review which you might film helpful :)"
Very intense from start to finish . The different twists and triangles in the story make it one of the best movies of all times .
"I like cop-crime movies where you get the badge, the gun, the bad and good guys, shoot-outs, drugs, lotsa money and a chase scene or two. It is interesting to see how powerful the cops are, how powerful the law-breakers are and what drugs and money do to people and why. Cop-crime movies give you all that and more. We kick into medium gear and shift rather quickly into third where we are held fast for the rest of the movie. We are in on the chase and we go from one lead to another guns drawn, radios giving intel, car crashes and support from HQ. The cop on point does a decent job of delivering us his part of the movie but I must say this movie would have really gripped the road if they had a named star in this role with appropriate supporting cast. Not complaining but just an observation. One word of advice when watching this fast-paced thriller. Don't get ahead of the movie. Let the movie show the way. Strongly recommend a finger food to keep nails from being bitten at certain points of the flick. NOTE: I noticed something worth mentioning i.e. the gunfire. They use high-power guns and they pop off realistically making you cringe. Return fire is just as intense. Also enjoy the underworld of crime which is organized and full of connections that the big money buys. I am putting out a APB to watch this movie. Shots fired officer down but why?"
The movie is a total cliche. A good cup and the res of the dirty cups. Also I think they used race to attract people to watch the movie. The African American people are shown more positive and white people are shown more dark and dirty. As always the head of the police dep is dirty and trying to cover a mess. Story ends as you could expect in these types of movies
"From the opening scene you cop the brunt of what you hope won't be a terrible script. Unfortunately it doesn't get any better. I'm not sure what the film was trying to do or trying to be. I'm really not. It feels like they were trying to make it a little confusing so they could reveal a twist at the end, but they blatantly give it away in the early stages.It's hard to say if there were any good performances with the dialogue they had to contend with. I think Stephan James (Beale Street, Homecoming (TV)) was decent, but that was about it for me.There is some nice cinematography and the movie is visually appealing, but that's all I can take out of it."
"You can tell discount Sanda Bullock is a tough gal due to her thick Brooklyn accent (spoiler). If you like drone shots bring a bottle of lube. Disappointed black panther wasn't in this. Controversial topics present, sending mixed messages, shoot cops or don't shoot cops. Overall I prefer Miss congeniality."
"The action is good, the acting too, nice twist. It has some problems and it's not perfect but it's a really good movie."
This is roght up there with the lukes of pride and glory and other corrupt cop movies.
"I didn't expect much and I wasn't disappointed.
The plot was unoriginal
The acting was ok but even JK seemed to be phoning it in
The action was over the top for a "" taut crime thriller"".
It wasn't smart or engaging.
Having the Russo Brothers involved I expected something better. This is a run of the mill crime "" thriller"" the likes of which we've seen again and again. If you liked it, cool, I'm glad you found something to like. To me, this movie felt like it was cranked out on an assembly line."
"Not a bad film, some good action scenes & good acting but very predictable, nothing really that I haven't seen before, felt also like the script was stretched out so much as to be honest, the film could of easily just been an hour."
"The trailers showed most of the excitement and the plot was easy to guess. Apparently, Chadwick wants to show some diversity or this was just a money grab?"
"Too much of the lead trying to act like the Black Panther. He had a hard time with his accent. I think he's a typical one role actor, Black Panther, who will have a hard time finding other roles."
"21 Bridges feels like the sort of police thriller commonly made in the 1970s. The plot moves swiftly and clearly with decent tension and action. Some of the plot twists are predictable, but the film does not hinge on these surprises. The performances are all solid. New Yorkers will readily notice that this New York City-set film clearly was mostly filmed elsewhere."
Your typical police chase film with a few new elements added to it. Chadwick Boseman does a great job as the lead with a few predictable outcomes.
"Chad did a very good job of acting. However, there was some parts missing. Actors and actress weren't used correctly. This movie was also too predictable. I felt like I saw this movie multiple times. Still a very good movie from the visual aspect."
"21 Bridges tells the story of a detective who joins a citywide manhunt and comes across a deeper conspiracy. I was excited for this film. The trailers looked intriguing and I'm a huge fan of Chadwick Boseman and with the Russo's producing I though we could be onto something. Sadly I left this film feeling entertained but extremely overwhelmed.21 Bridges has a good concept: a city wide manhunt, conspiracy, racial tensions as well and I had a good cast to boot. Chadwick Boseman does a really good job in this film and carries it on its shoulders. It's also made up of some fun action scenes some shootouts, but it's all the standard stuff we've seen before.21 Bridges problem is the half baked script with familiar ideas that aren't given to us in a fresh new way but more of a recycled way. It feels lazy as well as weak. This makes a lot of the film just a by the numbers cop drama. That doesn't mean it's bad. It's an enjoyable movie, but it's not going to stick with me much after finishing it.21 Bridges has a good cast good acting, it's slick, it's fast paced, action packed but it's story remains flimsy filled with ideas we've seen before with nothing new added."
"I was just looking for an entertaining matinee on a chilly afternoon and this fit the bill perfectly. No surprises but great acting all the way around. The whole movie takes place in the dead-of-night Manhattan ... some gritty characters ... and the protagonist an interesting character, along with being a great shot."
"21 Bridges is a decent film that's perfectly average. It's main strength lies in its fast pace and a runtime that doesn't overstay its welcome. The acting is servicable, as is the action. The plot is quite shlocky but the movie doesn't fully commit to its ridiculousness. And that's why I think this movie would've been much better if it was released in 1991. The same premise starring Wesley Snipes spouting some one-liners Passenger 57 style would've been awesome. Simple action movies like this were made much better back then as they were amped up to 11 and had very charismatic leads and villains. That's not to say Chadwick Boseman is bad in this but it looks like he thought he was starring in a much more serious film. It's hard to imitate the style of action movies of yesteryear but the simple solution is to let directors and actors have more fun, make it more like Fast & Furious. Not everything needs to be overly serious and 21 Bridges could've definietly benefitted from being more shlocky."
"Having slightly lower expectations made this movie pop a bit. The plot is predictable but unfolds on the screen well. The actors and actresses were cast effectively and play the characters well. A few good, tense scenes. Would recommend."
"While this film is easy to figure out, the action is really good. Contrast the film, The 75, and take it for what it is."
"21 Bridges reminds me of a lot of other action-crime-dramas but that doesn't necessarily mean it's not a good film on its own merits. Produced by the Russo Brothers, the Chadwick Boseman led corruption thriller centered in NYC feels like it deserves to be a summer blockbuster. It has the talent, twists, and popcorn thrills to be just that but it seems destined to be forgotten this fall. It's unfortunate because the movie is dang good and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout. But perhaps it either needed to go a little smaller in scale with a tighter script or way bigger with bigger names in front of the camera and a slicker feel. But amidst all of the wonderful Oscar films coming out this time of year, I love a good throwback thriller.7.6/10"
"Predictable? Perhaps a little. Definitely not boring for a second. This film's script varies from brilliant to decent at some moments.It's a premise we're all familiar with: so called 'good guys' are the real baddies and our hero starts out helping them stop the lesser evil. Cops turned sour by corruption and greed.21 Bridges doesn't dazzle with anything spectacular (except maybe it's cinematography), but it does everything well.Definitely more than deserving of a viewing!"
"Two apparently inexperienced thugs (with heavy military training) try to rob a drug dealer. The were expecting 30K of cocaine and find out 300K. Something is wrong there. Police arrives unexpected and get into the building; the thugs kill seven cops in the getaway.
A NY detective with some family history and fame of being a cop killer killer is call to follow the case and pushed to carry vengeance (exterminate the killers). In order to do that, he closes the 21 bridges (and subways) that connect Manhattan to the rest of the world and the chase begin. A female narcotics detective is assigned to work with him. Nothing of course is what it seems and many things are very rotten.
21 Bridges had a lot of potential. The two veterans basically thrown away from society and one of the visible a nutcase. The very thin line between criminals and police. The corruption and the reasons for it but the movie decides to stay on the light action/suspense side and it becomes quite predictable.
Perhaps the biggest failure of the movie is the main character portrayed by Chadwick Boseman. He is not a bad actor; but his character (himself perhaps ) are too bland for police whose father was kill on duty. He is good in the action scenes (however killing 5 without been hurt was a little to much) but his character does not generates empathy. On the other hand Sienna Miller as the narcotic cop with an agenda, makes quite strong character.
The two thugs Taylor Kitsch and Stephan James owns the movie every scene they are in. Their chemistry is undeniable.
Kitsch makes quite good nutcase with violent tendencies but on the other hand James is incredible charismatic as a person who made a big mistake and cannot go back.
J.K. Simmons is just ok; but is able to steal the show in his last scene. He is convincing even when his arguments cannot hold water.
In brief; it is good way to spend one hour and forty minutes with reasonable suspense. But if you are looking for a more social cop drama go to see Black and Blue"
"21 BridgesI really enjoyed this movie, this really has been a golden year for cop movies as we were all ready treated to Dragged Across Concrete, and I think this genre of movie is much undervalued.Some reviewers seem determined to dismiss a relatively straightforward linear story because it doesn't have either ""worthy"" issues or address ""me to"", ""times up"", and all the other PC fashion trends. I for one think it's a blessed relief.Andre, played by Chadwick Boseman brought a nuanced palette of intensity, dominating every scene effortlessly, and as for Sienna Miller, she is on a roll, we had American Woman and now a conniving New Yorker. Again her accent didn't slip once and she was entirely convincing.The directing was crisp and inspired and the time slipped by and everyone had a good time.I giving this a solid 8/10 for a gripping story well told."
"I had a good feeling about this movie and I was right, good old cop movie like something of the 70/ 80s... Great plot, suspense, action & drama with a good cast"
Movie delivers on the tried and true good guy against the system. Not particularly original but provides classic police drama. Fairly easy to see the plot. You know this can only end but one or two ways.
"When Brian Kirk directs the funeral of André Davis's father in 21 Bridges, you see the whole of the NYPD paying respect to their fallen comrade in a fantastic overhead scene. And André grows up unafraid to take out those who kill cops, as he follows his father into the service. He never shoots first though, as Chadwick Boseman tells the IA investigation. That's fair then. He'll only take out cop killers with reason. So give him a reason.And when small time thieves Taylor Kitsch and Stephan James take on a job to steal 30 kilos of coke on ice, the stakes are raised when there is an unexpected 300 kilos of pure, uncut drugs in the freezer. And all hell breaks loose when the local police turn up. Armed with automatic weapons the pair leave all eight of NYPD's finest dead, along with the wine shop manager. André now has a reason.J.K. Simmons, how great an actor is he?, as the precinct captain, specifically wants him on the job. The 85th have just lost eight of their colleagues. He wants him to shoot first, ask questions later. Clean kills will give closure to the families, with no criminal cases and appeals going on for years. Shoot first doesn't seem to be André's style, but he is paired with Sienna Miller from Narcotics, seems reasonable given the drugs haul, and her Frankie Burns, with a daughter at home, wants to know that André has her back. André would prefer to work alone, but he does, when she's wearing that badge. And she really wants him to shoot first.The FBI want the job but André fights for the NYPD to find the killers themselves. He figures out who they are dealing with from the bullet shells, how many shooters there are, and the fact they aren't likely to get out of Manhattan. The Sopranos isn't real! His plan? Locking Manhattan down. Shut down the bridges, close the rivers, block the tunnels, stop the trains and loop the subway. Then flood the island with blue to flush out the criminals.Meanwhile our shellshocked small-time crooks make it to their rendezvous, where they are caught on camera, and manage to get across to the drug dealers who gave them the job. Cutting a better deal with their haul, now worth unexpected millions, they are given a fixer's details; Gotham's Alexander Siddig's Adi. He gives them new identities and explains how they can clean the money through him. But more NYPD police arrive unexpectedly. They have a knack of turning up at just the right time. And our two small time crooks, now splashed across the tv news, are starting to suspect something isn't right, as they blast their way out of another gunfight. It was Taylor Kitsch's Michael who pulled his gun on the cops, and Stephan James's Ray took out the shop manager. Both veterans, and both now well and truly in the police line of fire.It's difficult to catch a good cops and robber story these days, the edges are so blurred!, but Brian Kirk keeps the action fast and tight in the amazing backdrop of the city (apparently filmed in Philly), but it's a cinematographers dream with the New York skyline, and has gunfights and chases galore. And the noose is getting ever tighter for Ray and Michael as André keeps narrowing down their neighbourhood. But he only has until 5am before Manhattan has to be reopened, and the FBI take over. The NYPD want them dead before then. Even if André wants to keep them alive to tell their side of a story that doesn't add up. Michael and Ray running into 300 kilos of coke was either a set up, or just bad luck. Neither good. But it's up to trigger happy André to figure out which, and how high, and how wide, this thing goes.Throw in a few vampires and you would really have a dusk til dawn partee. They'll love the blood! And Taylor, Taylor, Taylor, I remember you so long ago in Covenant, here with Stephan James you really picked the wrong drugs deal, and you never stood a chance. But can you really blame them?, as J.K. Simmons explains. But is his Captain McKenna feeling lucky?"
"21 Bridges is an awesome movie with a great story, acting, Directing and cinematography go see it!"
"Don t sleep much so love to watch these detective 3 peats daily on Me Tv starts 2 am pst m thru fri

Chadwick Bozeman Fans Must See
Good Cop Bad Cops in Nyc .........Wide Camera Shots of Big Apple"
"Just came out of the cinema and I have to say, I really enjoyed every minute! There was not a single second wasted for unnecessary scenes.
Good story telling, solid acting, nice scenes with matching sound!
I do recommend this movie to everyone who likes detective/cop thrillers."
"21 Bridges is a pretty good movie to enjoy all the cop action. Chadwick Boseman is the one top actor we need to be a hero of 21 Bridges. He knows all the cop work, and all the crimes, and the only way out is him. Don't mess with Black Panther. Wakanda Forever!"
"This was a solid and enjoyable action film, nothing really unpredictable.Wish Sienna Miller wasn't such a terrible actress."
Fast paced with lots of action. Involving story with Interesting character development. Chadwick Boseman and Stephen James give very good performances. A very good urban cop thriller.
"The basic storyline is nothing new, but it is very well presented. Great action sequences, well paced, keeps your attention with 3-dimensional characters. Actors Chadwick Boseman and Stephan James really shine, delivering complex and relatable characters. The visuals are stunning. As the action takes place at night, there is a dark backdrop with lights used strategically. The camerawork and great direction make up for the fairly unoriginal plot. Thumbs up, well worth the cinema ticket."
Plot slowly evolves amid practically non-stop action and intense police work. Some great scenes of Manhattan. End story effective and also filled with action.
"C.Boseman as a child has his cop father killed in action by some crackheads. He grows up to be a cop himself but with a tendency to shoot first and ask questions later leading to him being called up in front of a tribunal for his trigger happy ways . He says "" ya gotta look the devil in the eye "" and luckily that seems to satisfy the tribunal. Tough interview ! A whole bunch of cops are killed in a shootout with a couple of gangsters and our hero is set loose on them with the suggestion that he not bring them in alive to save the families of deceased cops the agony of seeing them go through the court system. Very early on it becomes clear that dirty cops are involved .I wouldn't exactly call this a spoiler as anyone with two brain cells could figure it out once the action starts ......and what a lot of action there is ! Unfortunately most of it involves armed stand-offs between two characters ..... bad guy V bad guy .... bad guy V cop .... cop V cop ....I lost count after a while . The dialogue is risible . At one point the heros' cell phone rings and he barks into it ""talk to me !"" .... has anyone in the real world ever said this unless making fun of cheesy dialogue ? Actually I left before end during yet another guns-drawn dialogue so maybe it managed to turn itself around in the last 20 minutes or so. I have my doubts."
"We have Chadwick Boseman in this movie, give him some action scenes! All he does for 70% of the movie is go to a crime scene, make some macho man talk or yell at people, and then say ""We got a new lead, everyone follow me,"" only to do the same thing again.He is a great leading action star, let the man kick some ass, not just stand around and talk while other characters do all the shooting and stuff. He does get his moment to shine, but it is not until the very end of the movie when he gets to take on 4-5 guys by himself in a house. Before that he shoots one guy, chases people on the streets and subway, and aims guns at people while giving orders.Another issue is that the movie is kinda boring and bland until the final 30 minutes when things really start to get interesting. The story is very very predictable and you can tell who is the ""real"" bad guy as soon as this person enters the screen. They made it so obvious who is bad, might as well just had this character hold a sign saying ""I am the real bad guy here.""The tension doesn't rev you up until the final 30 minutes, even though you can tell they were really aiming for a ""non-stop thrill ride with the story moving in real time."" It just didn't work as good as they wanted it to unfortunately.I really wanted to like this movie, but they did not take full advantage of Chadwick Boseman's leading man status, and the story ultimately is not about him. It is kinda a weird jumble mess that involves all characters big and small.6/10"
The movie is amazing it keeps you hooked i loved it the cinematography was amazing
Great suspense thriller. Once it picks up with action it doesn't stop.
This is a good action movie with a pretty good plot and plenty of fast action. There is plenty of gun fire and the body count quickly stacks up.I was a little disappointed in some of the acting and I thought the twist was pretty obvious but this is a good Friday night movie to just sit back and enjoy.
"I thought the Actors did a fantastic job of bringing a well written story to life. It was not your typical - if you have seen one cop thriller, you have seen them all - type of movie! I loved the fact that the film had some unexpected twist and turns and was not predictable in the end. The action packed, high adrenaline, pace of the movie kept me engaged and on the edge of my seat but was also balance out with some suspense. It was an awesome Cop thriller movie and a must see! If fact, I would go see it again! Kudos to 21 Bridges."
"If you're looking for a fun action where you can turn off your brain and not think about it, this is the movie for you. The movie has alright action scenes and doesn't excel in any way. It's very predictable and by the first 25 minutes you know how the movie is going to end. Not bad, not great, just meh"
"I so wanted to love this movie. The Russo Brothers and Boseman together again? Yes please! Neither have disappointed me in their Marvel outings so a cop flick should be fun right?Well, kinda. Chadwick Boseman is great, the guy has a presence on screen and I really look forward to seeing what he does in the future. In 21 Bridges he's solid, captivating at times as the righteous cop, a man guided by unselfish morality. J.K. Simmons is here too, once again flexing his greatness in a limited role. Everyone else in this is pretty one dimensional, even though a few characters aspire for more.The action is slick and fun. There are legitimate moments of tension that had me on the edge of my seat. There's even a great speech in this movie regarding the lives of police officers.Sadly, at the end of the day, this never gets to that level it's reaching for. There's too much plot convenience. Too many instances where things are telegraphed and thereby undo any sense of surprise.This movie also does something I can't say I've seen before. It feels like it took a scene from the trailer and put it in the movie instead of it being the other way around. In the trailer there's the title moment when Boseman announces that there are 21 bridges to Manhattan and that they need to shut down the island. That's fine, a lot of movies have a self-identifying line like that. This one really plays it up though with some dramatic music and build up that instantly yanked me from the movie and right back into the trailer. It was just too over the top. But, over the top is kind've the name of the game here.If you like cop movies, this might be a good fit for you. With the exception of the sound though, there's not really a huge reason to see this on the big screen."
"When i went today to watch this movie i thought it will be an average movie and I didn't make a high expectation; But during the movie i was really shocked. It is very entertaining and thrilling. It reminded me with old classic action movies such as HEAT and The Training Day ... you will not blink throughout the movie. All the aspects were really good direction , script, music and the cinematography was really good."
"Just because something is generic and, even, a little forgettable doesn't mean it isn't good. '21 Bridges (2019)' is a prime example of this. It's a really solid action-thriller, despite its tried-and-tested narrative. It does, in fact, belongs to a sub-genre that's far more prolific than you might think; it's certainly among the best. The story focuses on a tough-on-crime cop, portrayed by a slightly underused Boseman, who may not be as ruthless as everyone says. His defining principle is that he thinks first and shoots second, a quality that pretty much every other member of his police department seems to lack. It's refreshing to see this as a character strength as opposed to an internal obstacle, with the movie as a whole placing cerebral prowess over a quick trigger finger. Of course, there is plenty of action to go around and the protagonist isn't exactly sloppy when it comes to combat. The shootouts all feel decidedly crunchy here, with an emphasis on speed and brutality that's often missing from similar ilk. The sound design, especially, is fantastic, with each accurately loud pop of suppressed fire audibly blowing chunks off everything it hits. The piece has an excellent sense of tone and pacing, powering through its focal night with little time wasted and nary an immersion-breaking joke in sight. There is humour, but it's relatively underplayed and it never feels jarring. Neither do the predictable twists and turns. They aren't so much overly telegraphed as they are undeniably clichéd, but they feel at home here and typically make the story more interesting. Obviously, the plot isn't superb. Its basic nature is only elevated by a few decent, if under-explored, semi-themes and several enjoyable action set-pieces. The cast, too, are an integral part of the flick's overall success, admirably working with their archetypes to create an assortment of engaging secondary characters. James, especially, brings life to his surprisingly well-rounded role, managing to steal our attention away from the star on more than one occasion. It also helps that his character is the most intriguing of the lot, mainly down to his fairly nuanced representation and fish-out-of-water feel. The movie's music is a little heavy-handed but it works well enough, helping to establish that grounded tone I mentioned earlier. Overall, the experience is highly entertaining. It isn't exactly unique and it does fade from memory faster than many others, but it's a well-executed and compelling film nevertheless. 7/10"
"I saw ""21 Bridges"", starring Chadwick Boseman-Black Panther, Gods of Egypt; Sienna Miller-American Sniper, G.I. Joe:The Rise of Cobra; J.K. Simmons-the Spider_Man movies, La La Land and Taylor Kitsch-John Carter, Snakes on a Plane.
This is a crime thriller that is produced by Anthony & Joe Russo, who had a hand in Captain America:Civil War, Avengers:Infinity War & Avengers:Endgame, so you know it's going to be good. Chadwick plays a New York detective that is dedicated to his job. Probably, because his father was a cop that was killed in the line of duty. Chadwick has a reputation of taking down bad guys-especially cop killers-but he always does it clean. He never fires first, always in self defense. Taylor plays a low level-but deadly-thief that learns of a drug house that is ripe for the taking. The problem is, it was supposed to be 30 kilos of cocaine but there was 300 kilos-someone was off in their math by a zero. Things go bad-cops show up-and Taylor & his partner end up killing 8 cops in their escape. J.K. is the police captain that wants Chadwick on the case and he tells him that he doesn't have to bring them in alive. Sienna is a DEA agent that partners up with Chadwick. The first thing Chadwick does is get the mayor to shut down all 21 Bridges to Manhattan-nobody in or out-as well as the subways, too. The police are combing the whole island but Chadwick finds that there is more going on than he was led to believe-yes, there are some twists. It is action packed with never a dull moment.
It's rated ""R"" for violence & language and has a running time of 1 hour & 39 minutes.
I really enjoyed this one and I would buy it on Blu-Ray."
"21 bridges
2019
15
director: Brian Kirk
starring: Chadwick Boseman,Sienna Miller,jk Simmons,Taylor Kitsch and Stephan James etcoverall rating 31/10021 bridges follow the story of Andre Davis ( Chadwick boseman) as there is a drug robbery that turns violent when 8 police officers are killed. And Andre must hunt these two men down and learn the answers to all the mystery. Wow this film was absolutely terrible the whole script,plot and narrative was just wrong and it needed to have a few more drafts to make it at least passable for a movie.Lets start off with a couple of very limited positives. The action was very good,and there was a solid build up of tension throughout. The action was very sudden and fast paced so left you shocked and entertained for those small periods of time. And the film did have a solid build of tension. As you got more on edge wondering who would survive the ordeal and who wouldn't. And what helped this building of tension slightly was the creative set locations chosen for the action sequences. There places where there was a shop with loads of stacked shelves and even a slaughterhouse,these were creative as you couldn't see where the antagonists were so therefore you were on edge the whole time.However the film had very slow pacing and bad execution of its humour. Wow despite the films good action sequences it was boring and slow. It was just filled with filler conversations that didn't hold much importance to the plot at all. It was frustrating as i wanted it to start getting good and exciting but it didnt. And the films humour was terrible. They tried for some humorous moments but they were not funny at all. Therefore making the film really awkward to watch in places.Next the film was very generic and the main villain Michael ( stephan James) was wrongly used. The film had such a generic formula. It was frustrating as it had the potential to go for something different but it never did. It just followed all of the other cop thriller tropes. Therefore making it forgettable. And the fact that the film was called 21 bridges and yet they were mentioned pretty much once shows you how bad this film was. And the main antagonist was not used correctly. Stephan Jameses performance was good enough. But they teased him having second thoughts during the robbery but they went nowhere with it which was frustrating.My final two positives for the movie would be the performance of Chadwick Boseman and his character was interesting at times. Chadwick proved himself to be a great actor here and proves that he can branch outside of marvel and do different projects with the right movie which this wasn't. But his character was interesting and he had good dialogue to say. And avenging his fathers death by capturing cop killers was interesting.Next there was to many plot holes and the ending was terrible. There was to many plot points within the film that just did not make sense whatsoever. Charecters were randomly killed for no reasons and there was just so many lapses in the logic with the plot. And the ending was terrible. The ending was anticlimactic. They tried to make you sympathise with the antagonist which didn't work. And its plot twists were terrible,predictable and not fleshed out enough.And my final two negatives would be the films lack of plot and no middle act. Wow the script of the structure was beyond poor. The film just didn't have enough plot to justify its runtime,which i must add was only one hour and forty minutes. The whole film can just be explained as a drug robbery gone wrong. the main character hunts them and kills them and thats it just terrible. And the film literally did not have a middle act at all. It had a small first act. And then an extremely dragged out final act that was just to long and bland and horrible.Overall despite the performance of Chadwick. 21 bridges underperforms in every aspect a film needs. It needed a new script,better characters and a more exciting plot."
This is a typical cop chasing criminal crime film. And these kind of films have been made so many times in these decades. Nothing new in this film - just boring and predictable.
"Good movie, good acting, nice shooting scenes, suspenseful and interesting. Kept my attention. Worth watching..."
"""I just need the truth that's all"". So says Andre ""Dre"" Davis in 2019's 21 Bridges (my latest review). The ""truth"", is that ""Bridges"" is nastily punchy and far from being jejune. Not a second goes by when a Glock 19, a Beretta, or a rifle silencer isn't being drawn. Not a minute goes by when someone isn't being chased or shot via point-blank range.21 Bridges while energized, still feels like recycled, dirty po-po movies in the stylings of Street Kings, Pride and Glory, Sleepless, and 2001's Training Day. It's about a NYC detective who closes down the viaducts connecting Manhattan in order to seek out some nasty cop killers.Violent, loud, he-man scripted, and containing a few plot holes (and bad New Yorker accents), ""Bridges"" feels a little cop thriller, film noir in its approach. Most of New York in ""Bridges"" looks overly dark with obvious soundstages masquerading as actual locales. What does actually look like the ""Big Apple"", is a few hazy aerial shots that are numerously sprinkled throughout.Directed by a rookie in Brian Kirk (he is mostly a TV and shorts guy) and garnering a 100-minute running time, 21 Bridges comes off a little unfinished with its editing team appearing as though they're scurrying to put out a finished project. Most of the back-stories entailing the side characters (and lead) are trite. Plus, the ""Bridges"" film score by Henry Jackman is overly serious to the point of being daft.Oh well. ""Bridges"" packs a guilty wallop if you like standard police drama twists, intervals of hailed gunfire (you can literally smell the bullets), tough-talking swipe, and lots of badass stares from Mr. Black Panther himself (that would Chadwick Boseman). ""He never freezes"". My assessment: 21 Bridges ""crosses over"" to a 2 and a half star rating."
"This is a movie created around a what-if scenario. What if it were necessary to close all access in or out of Manhattan in order to catch some bad guys, what would happen? This is really the central premise of this movie. Everything else (plot, characters, script and score) was added to support this premise. The first part of the movie is a build up to the the big ""close the bridges, block the tunnels, flood the island with blue"" speech delivered by Chadwick Boseman. The music crescendos to its loudest and most dramatic at this moment. Prior to that scene and after, the movie is chock full of 90's cop movie action and clichés. You have your New York City setting, your detective with his trigger happy reputation, tons of corrupt cops, the sudden assignment of a partner that isn't needed or wanted, your layered New York accents flying all over the place, bad guys and cops running down the middle of city streets and your everyday run of the mill car chase scenes that include driving on sidewalks and even a cop car crashing into (wait for it) a produce stand! If you've seen any of the Lethal Weapon movies you've seen all of these clichés before (minus the New York setting and the accents). Even the score could have been lifted from the Lethal Weapon series. Chadwick Boseman holds his own but sadly there isn't a whole lot to work with here. I flirted with the idea of leaving before the end but decided to wait it out. I'm glad I did because the end of the movie gave me a little of the entertainment that I was hoping I would see throughout. This is why I didn't rate the movie lower. If you're not going to add anything new to the corrupt New York City cop genre, why make it?"
"This film has nothing to recommend it. The ac ting is wooden, direction plodding, photography average, and the story is wacked."
If you saw the preview for this then you pretty much know the entire story. Don't waste your money actually seeing this. If it came out on TV for free (which it never will) I still could not recommend watching it.
Apart from really nice birds eye views of Manhattan this movie was bad. Sienna Miller was appalling. The plot was not interesting and even Chadwick Bozeman wasn't good. I won't recommend it...
"I'll preface this by saying i did enjoy this movie, and i would recommend it to fans or crime thrillers. that being said, they had to stretch plot points far and wide for 21 bridges to make any sense at all. the unfortunate thing is, it wasn't necessary at all. knowing how the story ends, i see many many ways the ""career criminals"" could have been tracked down... but to put it all on THE CRIMINALS...USING THEIR OWN CAR AS A GETAWAY VEHICLE... please. this isn't my very first ever crime drama thriller, so don't try and throw some ridiculous BS at us. since the 60's movies and tv shows AND REAL LIFE have portrayed STEALING A GETAWAY VEHICLE, so why the hell did these guys use their own car?!?! to move the plot along... with writing that is below CW quality, and that says a lot. this could have been a great movie, or an amazing series... but unfortunately someone with absolutely no knowledge of police or criminal procedures and apparently no knowledge of movies or tv shows in the last 70 years."
